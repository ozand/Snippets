## 1. Introduction

*   **1.1 Project Name:** (e.g., "Customer Sentiment Analysis System")
*   **1.2 Project Goals:** Describe the high-level goals of the project. What problem does it solve? What are the desired outcomes? (e.g., "To provide real-time insights into customer sentiment regarding L'OrÃ©al products, enabling proactive responses to negative feedback and identification of product improvement opportunities.")
*   **1.3 Project Scope:** Define the boundaries of the project. What is included, and what is explicitly excluded? (e.g., "This project includes analysis of social media data, customer reviews, and survey responses. It excludes analysis of internal sales data.")
*   **1.4 Target Audience:** Who is this documentation for? (e.g., Developers, testers, project managers, stakeholders).  *Consider providing different levels of documentation for different audiences.*

## 2. Project Logic and Functionality

*   **2.1 Overall System Architecture:** A high-level overview of how the system works. Describe the major components and their relationships.  *Consider using a C4 model diagram for architectural visualization (Context, Containers, Components, Code).*
*   **2.2 Detailed Logic:** Explain the logic behind the key features and functions. This section should be very specific.  *Use flowcharts or sequence diagrams to illustrate complex logic.*
    *   For example, if it's an e-commerce project:
        *   **User Authentication:** Describe the login process, password management, and security measures.
        *   **Product Search:** Explain how users can search for products (keywords, categories, filters).
        *   **Shopping Cart:** Describe how items are added, removed, and updated in the shopping cart.
        *   **Checkout Process:** Explain the steps involved in placing an order (shipping address, payment information, order confirmation).
    *   If it's a data analysis project:
        *   **Data Acquisition:** Describe the sources of data and how it's collected.
        *   **Data Preprocessing:** Explain the steps taken to clean, transform, and prepare the data for analysis.
        *   **Analysis Techniques:** Describe the statistical methods or machine learning algorithms used.
        *   **Reporting and Visualization:** Explain how the results are presented.

*   **2.3 Use Cases:** Describe how different users will interact with the system. Use cases are short descriptions of how a user achieves a specific goal.
    *   Example:
        *   **Use Case Name:** "Place an Order"
        *   **Actor:** Customer
        *   **Description:** The customer browses the online store, adds items to their shopping cart, enters shipping and payment information, and confirms the order.
        *   **Pre-conditions:** The customer has an account or chooses to checkout as a guest.
        *   **Post-conditions:** An order is created in the system, and the customer receives an order confirmation.

## 3. Modules and Components

*   **3.1 Module Breakdown:** Describe the different modules or components of the system. Explain the purpose of each module and its responsibilities.
    *   Example:
        *   **Module Name:** "User Authentication Module"
        *   **Description:** Handles user registration, login, and password management.
        *   **Responsibilities:** Verifying user credentials, storing user information securely, generating authentication tokens.
*   **3.2 Module Interfaces:** Describe how the modules interact with each other. What data is exchanged between modules? What are the APIs or interfaces used for communication?  *Clearly define the input and output data formats for each module.*
*   **3.3 External Libraries and Frameworks:** List all external libraries, frameworks, and dependencies used in the project. Include version numbers. Explain why each library was chosen. (e.g., "We used React v18 for the front-end because of its component-based architecture and large community support."). *Document any known compatibility issues or licensing restrictions.*

## 4. System Architecture Diagram

*   Provide a visual representation of the system architecture. This can be a block diagram, a component diagram, or a deployment diagram.  *Use Mermaid diagrams for a text-based representation.*

            int custID PK
            string name
            string address
        }
        ORDER {
            int orderID PK
            int custID FK
            date orderDate

**Key Considerations and Tips (from Roo):**

*   **Keep it Up-to-Date:** Documentation is only useful if it's accurate. Make sure to update the documentation whenever the system changes.  *Automate documentation updates as part of your CI/CD pipeline.*
*   **Use Clear and Concise Language:** Avoid jargon and technical terms that the target audience may not understand.  *Write for a global audience, considering translation needs.*
*   **Use Visuals:** Diagrams, charts, and screenshots can help to explain complex concepts.  *Use consistent styling and branding for all visuals. Use Mermaid where possible for easy updating.*
*   **Version Control:** Store the documentation in a version control system (e.g., Git) so that you can track changes.
*   **Collaboration:** Encourage team members to contribute to the documentation.
*   **Documentation as Code:** Treat documentation as code and apply the same development practices (version control, testing, review).
*   **Choose the Right Format:** Select the appropriate documentation format (Markdown, AsciiDoc) based on your needs and tools.  *Consider using a static site generator to create a professional-looking documentation website.*
