Perform a thorough code review of the entire project codebase, focusing on:

    Structure and Style: Evaluate the overall architecture, modularity, and adherence to coding standards (specify standards if possible, e.g., PEP 8 for Python, Google Style Guide for C++, etc.).

    Potential Issues: Identify bugs, vulnerabilities, performance bottlenecks, and areas of technical debt. Prioritize critical issues.

    Optimization: Suggest concrete improvements for performance, memory usage, and scalability. Include specific examples and potential performance gains.

    Code Quality: Provide actionable recommendations for improving readability, maintainability, testability, and overall code elegance.

    Deliverables: Generate a detailed report outlining findings, prioritized recommendations, and suggested code modifications (e.g., code snippets, pseudocode, or refactoring suggestions). Consider providing automated analysis results where applicable (e.g., static analysis tool outputs).
